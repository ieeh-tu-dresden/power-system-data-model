## <div id="application" /> Field of Application

This data model is intended to describe electrical power systems. It provides a hierarchical structure/schema to describe unique entity relations as well as parameter sets.

The data model is structured as the following schema:

- grid topology:
  - base topology containing all elements of the exported grid
  ![topology relationship diagram](./docs/topology.png)
- topology case;
  - information about disabled elements to represent a specific operational case based on the base topology
  ![topology case relationship diagram](./docs/topology_case.png)
- steadystate case
  - information about power draw/infeed for a specific operational case
  ![steadystate case relationship diagram](./docs/steady_state_case.png)

## <div id="remarks" /> General Remarks

Please find below some important general remarks and assumptions to consider for consistent usage across different applications:
- The passive sign convention should be used for all types of loads (consumer as well as producer).
- Numeric values should be set using the SI unit convention.
- Topology
  - The `Rated Power` should always be defined positive (absolute value).
- SteadyState
  - The interaction between load models and controllers are depicted in the following schematic:
